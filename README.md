# üì± **BFRB Management**  

A mobile application and wearable device system designed to help individuals manage **Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviours (BFRBs)**, such as hair pulling, nail biting, and skin picking. The tool aims to recognize, track, and visualize these behaviours to support users in better understanding and managing their habits.  

The system consists of a mobile app and a smartwatch integration. The smartwatch detects specific hand movements, such as raising the hand to the face, which may signal a BFRB. It then sends an alert to the app, which discreetly notifies the user in real time. Users can also view a summary of their recent behaviours through data visualizations.
